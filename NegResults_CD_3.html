<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CT enterography, or MR enterography is usually appropriate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, MRI abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast, CT abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, Fluoroscopy small-bowel follow-through , MRI abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, or US abdomen and pelvis &nbsp;may be appropriate. </strong></p>
<p><strong>CT abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast is usually not appropriate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In this clinical scenario, the purpose of the imaging evaluation is to determine the presence or absence of disease activity in a relatively well CD patient (ie, mildly symptomatic to asymptomatic) in order to help determine medical management. This is important because promoting situations of complete mucosal healing has been associated with sustained&nbsp; clinical&nbsp; remission,&nbsp; reduced&nbsp; hospitalization&nbsp; rates,&nbsp; and&nbsp; decreased&nbsp; need&nbsp; for surgery&nbsp; [12,13,105].&nbsp; As with endoscopy,&nbsp; imaging may&nbsp; better&nbsp; direct&nbsp; treatment&nbsp; based&nbsp; on objective&nbsp; findings&nbsp; because&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; known that &nbsp;subjective symptomatology and other clinical parameters have shown poor correlation with disease activity [106]. Secondly, when CD strictures are detected, imaging can help determine whether the narrowing is predominantly due to active inflammation or due to fibrosis. This distinction is critical because the former responds to medical interventions, whereas the latter would be better treated surgically. Because of the cost and significant complications of agents such&nbsp; as infliximab, empiric&nbsp; treatment&nbsp; with&nbsp; these agents to&nbsp; make&nbsp; this&nbsp; distinction&nbsp; (ie,&nbsp; does&nbsp; treatment&nbsp; improve&nbsp; the stenosis) is less attractive.</p>
<p><strong>CT Enterography</strong></p>
<p>CT enterography represents a CT examination with a specialized protocol. Neutral contrast by mouth is given in large amounts over a set time period to promote optimal distention of the small bowel [19-21]. Combined with other modifications, including thin collimation, multiplanar reconstruction, and IV contrast, this protocol maximizes the technique&nbsp; to&nbsp; depict&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; changes in&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; related&nbsp; to&nbsp; CD&nbsp; [20,22,23].&nbsp; Although&nbsp; the&nbsp; diagnostic performance is&nbsp; excellent&nbsp; (see below),&nbsp; the&nbsp; need&nbsp; for repeated&nbsp; examinations&nbsp; over&nbsp; time&nbsp; makes this&nbsp; a&nbsp; less attractive choice in this clinical variant.</p>
<p>The&nbsp; overall&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; performance for CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; is&nbsp; excellent.&nbsp; When&nbsp; an&nbsp; endoscopic&nbsp; standard&nbsp; is&nbsp; utilized, sensitivity for CD ranges from 75% to 90%, with a specificity of &gt;90% [24-27]. The diagnosis of acute inflammation is made through visualization of thickened small bowel with mural stratification as well as extraenteric processes including&nbsp; engorged vasa recti/vasculature&nbsp; and&nbsp; surrounding&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; stranding&nbsp; [25,26,32-34].&nbsp; Because&nbsp; of&nbsp; an excellent performance profile, CT enterography is able to assess for mucosal healing similar to MR enterography to help guide therapy [109]. One series (n = 63) demonstrated that CT enterography was able to detect wall changes, and&nbsp; influenced&nbsp; the&nbsp; treatment&nbsp; of&nbsp; CD&nbsp; patients&nbsp; [110].&nbsp; However,&nbsp; regarding strictures,&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; has&nbsp; been considered poor in its ability to distinguish between active and fibrotic contributions to the stricture based on the presence or absence of above-mentioned findings (ie, mural hyper enhancement, thickening, engorged vasa recta, surrounding soft tissue thickening, etc) [108].</p>
<p><strong>CT Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Standard abdomen and pelvis CT with IV contrast with a routine protocol (ie, without oral contrast enterographytechnique)&nbsp; can&nbsp; detect&nbsp; evidence for active CD.&nbsp; CT&nbsp; with&nbsp; positive&nbsp; luminal contrast&nbsp; can&nbsp; identify&nbsp; wall&nbsp; thickening,luminal narrowing,&nbsp; and&nbsp; adjacent&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; changes that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; seen&nbsp; in&nbsp; CD&nbsp; [39].&nbsp; However,&nbsp; mucosalenhancement&nbsp; is&nbsp; obscured&nbsp; and&nbsp; subtle&nbsp; enhancement&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; missed&nbsp; without&nbsp; the&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; optimization&nbsp; present&nbsp; withenterography technique.&nbsp; The&nbsp; decreased&nbsp; performance&nbsp; compared&nbsp; against&nbsp; other&nbsp; modalities &nbsp;with&nbsp; optimized&nbsp; bowelprotocol would argue against its use in this clinical variant in which the patient is relatively well and able to toleratethe increased oral contrast volumes. Standard abdomen and pelvis CT without IV contrast is further hampered whenevidence of increased vascularity seen with IV contrast use is not available.</p>
<p><strong>CT Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>CT enteroclysis is a CT-based examination in which a nasoduodenal tube is placed to allow controlled distentionof&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel.&nbsp; Typically,&nbsp; neutral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; is&nbsp; infused&nbsp; and&nbsp; IV&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; given.&nbsp; Because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; active infusion,stenoses are more easily determined [43]. There have been few studies evaluating performance in recent years. Theoverall diagnostic performance for CT enteroclysis is excellent (ie, &gt;85% sensitivity, &gt;90% specificity) [45-47], and this examination has been used as a reference standard for other modalities in various studies [41,47].</p>
<p>The&nbsp; diagnosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; acute&nbsp; inflammation&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; through visualization&nbsp; of&nbsp; thickened&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; with&nbsp; muralstratification&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; extraenteric&nbsp; processes,&nbsp; including&nbsp; engorged vasa recti/vasculature and&nbsp; surrounding inflammatory stranding [43,44]. Similar to CT enterography, the ability to detect even mild inflammation makes it useful in monitoring therapy. CT enteroclysis has been shown to be helpful in assessing the status of disease in CD patients post resection at the anastomosis [107]. However, the determination between active disease and fibrosis in a stricture remains difficult based on enhancement characteristics only [108]. Because CT enteroclysis is a cross-sectional&nbsp; imaging modality, assessment&nbsp; for alternative diagnoses&nbsp; as well&nbsp; for the&nbsp; possible&nbsp; complications&nbsp; of&nbsp; CDincluding&nbsp; obstruction,&nbsp; abscess,&nbsp; and&nbsp; fistula&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; made&nbsp; [43].&nbsp; Although CT&nbsp; enteroclysis represents one&nbsp; of&nbsp; themodalities&nbsp; with&nbsp; highest&nbsp; disease detection&nbsp; capabilities,&nbsp; the&nbsp; invasive&nbsp; nature&nbsp; with&nbsp; nasoduodenal&nbsp; tube&nbsp; insertion&nbsp; andactive infusion of contrast may make it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less favorable from a patient perspective, unless a mild stricture withoutdefinite&nbsp; proximal&nbsp; dilation&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; clinical&nbsp; question and&nbsp; active distention&nbsp; is&nbsp; needed&nbsp; to&nbsp; confirm&nbsp; this&nbsp; stricture&nbsp; [9].&nbsp; In addition, the need for repeated examinations over time makes this a less attractive choice in this clinical variant.</p>
<p><strong>MR Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>MR enteroclysis is a MR-based examination in which a nasoduodenal tube is placed to allow controlled distentionof the small bowel. Typically, biphasic enteral contrast (low signal on T1 and high signal on T2) is infused, and IV contrast&nbsp; is&nbsp; given.&nbsp; There have&nbsp; been&nbsp; few&nbsp; studies evaluating&nbsp; performance in&nbsp; recent&nbsp; years.&nbsp; The&nbsp; overall&nbsp; diagnostic performance for MR&nbsp; enteroclysis is&nbsp; excellent&nbsp; and&nbsp; at&nbsp; least&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; [49].&nbsp; One comparisonstudy between these two modalities demonstrated statistically better detection of superficial mucosal abnormalities over MR enterography but no difference for stenoses and fistulas [50].</p>
<p>In this specific variant, MR enteroclysis theoretically holds the same advantages as outlined for MR enterographybecause the difference between the two is related to active distention via the nasoduodenal tube at MR enteroclysisversus distention from oral ingestion at MR enterography. Thus, the ability to evaluate mucosal healing as well as assessment of strictures for active disease versus fibrosis as documented at MR enterography should be equivalentat&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enteroclysis [48].&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; invasive&nbsp; nature&nbsp; with&nbsp; nasoduodenal&nbsp; tube&nbsp; insertion&nbsp; and&nbsp; active infusion&nbsp; of contrast may make it&nbsp;&nbsp; less favorable from a patient perspective, unless a mild stricture without proximal dilation is the clinical question and active distention is needed to confirm this stricture [9]</p>
<p><strong>MR Enterography</strong></p>
<p>MR enterography combines contrast-enhanced MRI scanning using fast imaging techniques with an enterographyprotocol to optimize bowel distension [38]. As described with CT enterography, this requires the patient to ingest a large volume of oral contrast in a set time period. Additionally, the use of glucagon or prone imaging may help to&nbsp; decrease bowel peristalsis and thus artifact. MR enterography holds excellent test performance characteristics (seebelow) equivalent to other optimized modalities, such as CT enterography.</p>
<p>The performance of MR enterography for CD is very good. Rates of sensitivity and specificity are 77% to 82% and80% to 100%, respectively [24,66,67]; MR enterography can accurately display bowel-wall changes in CD [51-54]. Characteristic bowel-wall changes suggesting active inflammation include bowel-wall thickening, high T2 muralsignal, mural hyper enhancement with mural stratification, and hyperemic vasa recta [55-64]. MR cine imaging is potentially&nbsp; useful,&nbsp; allowing&nbsp; for assessment&nbsp; of&nbsp; decreased&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; motility&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affected&nbsp; segments&nbsp; with&nbsp; CD&nbsp; [65]. Besides inflammation, MRI can&nbsp; detect&nbsp; complications&nbsp; for CD&nbsp; including&nbsp; obstruction,&nbsp; abscess,&nbsp; or&nbsp; fistula. Testperformance characteristics for complications are similar to CT enterography [27,28,35,40,68,69].</p>
<p>MR&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; has been&nbsp; shown&nbsp; to&nbsp; correlate with&nbsp; response to&nbsp; therapy&nbsp; and&nbsp; mucosal&nbsp; healing&nbsp; [111,112].&nbsp; Oneprospective multicenter study (n&nbsp; = 48) showed 90% accuracy of ulcer healing determination at MR enterography, utilizing ileocolonoscopy as the reference standard [113]. In addition, MR is able to utilize natural tissue contrastat T2W imaging to help in the determination between active inflammation and fibrosis, which is not possible withCT-based modalities. DWI, magnetization transfer imaging, and cine sequences at MR enterography can also be helpful. [111].</p>
<p>MR enterography without IV contrast has been investigated because of emerging concerns with IV gadolinium useand potential long-term accumulation in the body and brain. Noncontrast techniques such as DWI have been usedto evaluate evidence for CD. There is growing literature examining its promise in detecting active disease versus quiescent disease for complication evaluation and disease monitoring [77]. Overall, DWI appears to have moderatesensitivity&nbsp; but&nbsp; low&nbsp; specificity,&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; increased&nbsp; false positives&nbsp; for disease&nbsp; activity&nbsp; [77].&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the&nbsp; currentconsensus is that noncontrast only techniques such as DWI can be done but there is likely improved performancewith the information gained from post IV contrast series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MRI Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Standard MRI with a routine protocol (ie, MRI without and with IV contrast and without oral contrast enterography technique) can detect evidence of CD if the patient cannot tolerate large volumes of oral contrast. However, the lackof bowel optimization decreases evaluation of inflammation compared with MR enterography with optimized boweltechnique.&nbsp; One&nbsp; study&nbsp; (n&nbsp; =&nbsp; 100)&nbsp; reported&nbsp; a&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 50%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 86%&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 93%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 94%&nbsp; for&nbsp; wallthickening [73].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The literature on mucosal healing and MR has centered on MR enterography as opposed to standard MR withoutenterography protocol. MR enterography has been shown to correlate with response to therapy and mucosal healing[111,112]. One prospective multicenter study (n = 48) showed 90% accuracy of ulcer healing determination at MRenterography, utilizing ileocolonoscopy as the reference standard [113]. In this specific clinical scenario, the patientis typically able to tolerate enterography technique, and consequently, bowel optimization should be undertaken as opposed to standard MRI for this situation.</p>
<p>For&nbsp; CD&nbsp; complications,&nbsp; the&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; ability&nbsp; of&nbsp; MRI&nbsp; is&nbsp; similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; its&nbsp; CT&nbsp; counterpart&nbsp; with&nbsp; similar&nbsp; reportedsensitivities and specificities in various&nbsp; series&nbsp; [27,40,58,72]. The sensitivity for stenosis/obstruction ranges from87%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 92%&nbsp; with&nbsp; high specificities;&nbsp; detection&nbsp; performance&nbsp; remains&nbsp; high for abscesses,&nbsp; with&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; rangingfrom 86% to 100%. As with CT, the detection for fistulas is more variable, ranging from 40% to 100%. Because ofthe&nbsp; superior &nbsp;soft-tissue contrast,&nbsp; perianal&nbsp; disease including&nbsp; fistulation&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; perineum&nbsp; is&nbsp; best&nbsp; evaluated&nbsp; at&nbsp; MRI,using a small field-of-view, focused examination [74-76].</p>
<p>Standard MRI without IV contrast has been investigated because of emerging concerns with IV gadolinium use andpotential long-term accumulation in the body and brain. Noncontrast techniques such as DWI have been used to evaluate evidence for CD.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; growing literature&nbsp; examining its&nbsp; promise&nbsp; in&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; active&nbsp; disease versusquiescent disease for complication evaluation and disease monitoring, although many of the studies involve DWIin the context of enterography technique [77]. One study without enterography technique [48] reported a sensitivityof 49% to 82% and specificity of 85% to 93% for DWI, alt&nbsp;&nbsp; hough lower specificities have been reported at meta-analysis [78].&nbsp; Overall,&nbsp; DWI&nbsp; appears to &nbsp;have&nbsp; moderate&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; but&nbsp; low&nbsp; specificity,&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; increased&nbsp; false positives for disease activity [77]. Thus, the current consensus is that noncontrast only techniques such as DWI can be done, but there is likely improved performance with the information gained from post IV contrast series. Thisreason, as well as the lack of a bowel distention optimization protocol, makes standard MRI without IV contrastless useful in this clinical variant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Radiography Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>Radiographs of the abdomen are limited in the evaluation for CD. The ability to directly visualize bowel pathologyis&nbsp; limited, and&nbsp; evidence for&nbsp; CD&nbsp; is&nbsp; instead&nbsp; inferred&nbsp; indirectly.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; little&nbsp; role&nbsp; for&nbsp; radiography in&nbsp; this&nbsp; clinicalvariant.</p>
<p><strong>Fluoroscopy Small-Bowel Follow-Through and Fluoroscopic Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>Historically, fluoroscopic contrast examinations of the gastrointestinal tract have been the primary imaging methodsof choice in the evaluation of CD.SBFT (with or without per oral pneumocolon) and enteroclysis can be used to evaluate the small bowel for evidence of thickening and active disease [50,79]. In addition, internal fistulas can be detected&nbsp; [80],&nbsp; although other&nbsp; extramural&nbsp; complications&nbsp; such&nbsp; as abscess&nbsp; formation&nbsp; are only&nbsp; indirectly&nbsp; visualized, which lead to decreased detection [27]. It has become evident; however, with the emergence of specialized cross sectional imaging modalities, that the performance of contrast fluoroscopy is not as accurate for active disease as compared with these other examinations [18,42,46,81,82]. Thus, there is little&nbsp; evidence to support its use in thisspecific clinical variant in which the inflammation may be very subtle.</p>
<p>Both SBFT and enteroclysis are hampered by their 2-D perspective, whereby pathology can be obscured because of overlapping bowel loops [18,82,83]. On the other hand, the real-time assessment for a fixed versus pliable natureof&nbsp; a&nbsp; segment&nbsp; of&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; can&nbsp; provide&nbsp; important&nbsp; ancillary&nbsp; information.&nbsp; Dependent&nbsp; on institutional and&nbsp; surgeonpreference, there may be a role in delineating the preoperative anatomy for the surgeon, although there has been a marked decline in fluoroscopic use over recent years.</p>
<p><strong>Fluoroscopy Contrast Enema</strong></p>
<p>Colonoscopy is the preferred initial examination of the colon in patients suspected of having inflammatory boweldisease [9].&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; superior &nbsp;to&nbsp; the&nbsp; barium&nbsp; enema for the&nbsp; detection&nbsp; of&nbsp; early&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; changes and&nbsp; has largelyreplaced it&nbsp;&nbsp; as the diagnostic examination [9].</p>
<p><strong>US Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Transabdominal US can be effective option in CD [84,85]. However, in this variant, it&nbsp;&nbsp; may not be optimal giventhat areas of the abdomen may not be assessed because of shadowing bowel. However, there is emerging literaturethat US may be useful in therapy monitoring of CD patients [114,115]. In addition, contrast-enhanced US may be helpful in distinguishing between inflammatory and fibrotic disease [95].</p>
<p>The technique requires a systematic survey pattern of the entire bowel with graded compression (ie, overlapping vertical sweeps with a high-frequency 5&ndash;17 MHz linear transducer) [11]. Sensitivities for disease detection rangefrom 75% to 94%, with specificities of 67% to 100% for CD with demonstration of wall thickening [66,86-88]. Thethreshold for abnormal thickening is typically set at 4 mm. Besides wall thickening, findings include alteration of the US gut signature, presence of fat wrapping, and vascular changes [89-92]. US contrast and Doppler techniquesappear&nbsp; helpful&nbsp; in&nbsp; determining inflammation&nbsp; [93-95].&nbsp; Like&nbsp; MRI,&nbsp; US&nbsp; holds&nbsp; advantages such&nbsp; as evaluating&nbsp; moreproximal small bowel segments [116]. In addition, the real-time assessment of bowel pliability and peristalsis canbe helpful in the diagnostic evaluation. Transperineal or endoanal US is also helpful at assessing perianal fistulousdisease related to CD [96].</p>
<p>Patient factors such&nbsp; as obesity&nbsp; and&nbsp; guarding may&nbsp; not&nbsp; allow&nbsp; adequate compression&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; US&nbsp; probe&nbsp; or&nbsp; large amounts of shadowing gas may obscure bowel, preventing an optimal examination. Location also affects diagnosisin which higher sensitivities for terminal ileal involvement are seen compared to more proximal small bowel [87].False positive diagnoses of abscesses are more likely at US [97].</p>
<p><strong>HMPAO WBC Scan</strong></p>
<p>Leucoscintigraphy&nbsp; or&nbsp; Tc-99m-HMPAO&nbsp; WBC scan&nbsp; have&nbsp; demonstrated good sensitivities&nbsp; and specificities for intestinal inflammation&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; 79%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 85%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 81% to&nbsp; 98%&nbsp; range,&nbsp; respectively&nbsp; [98].&nbsp; Proponents&nbsp; contend that leucoscintigraphy is useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of activity and extent of disease [99], with performance results equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; cross-sectional&nbsp; imaging [28].&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; disadvantages of&nbsp; this&nbsp; examination,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as the decreased ability to depict and therefore detect alternative diagnoses and the complicated time consuming technical aspects (ie, labeling and handling of blood products), have limited its use in evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp; addition&nbsp; of&nbsp; metabolic&nbsp; information&nbsp; from&nbsp; PET with&nbsp; the&nbsp; morphologic&nbsp; anatomic imaging&nbsp; of&nbsp; CT&nbsp; or&nbsp; MR&nbsp; shows promise. It may be helpful to better assess the level of active inflammation from fibrosis [100,101]. Studies also show improved assessment in the colon in a murine animal model [102], which points to potential future usefulness because the colon is less well evaluated at both CT enterography and MR enterography. At this point, there are few large-series published clinical studies but small series show promising results [103,104].</p>
