<p><strong>CT colonography&nbsp; - CTC</strong></p>
<p>CTC&nbsp; (also&nbsp; known&nbsp; as&nbsp; &ldquo;virtual&nbsp; colonoscopy&rdquo;)&nbsp; was&nbsp; introduced&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1994&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; less&nbsp; invasive&nbsp; method&nbsp; of&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; the&nbsp; colon&nbsp; by&nbsp; using&nbsp; helical&nbsp; CT.&nbsp; Similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; optical&nbsp; colonoscopy;&nbsp; patients&nbsp; undergo&nbsp; a&nbsp; preprocedural&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; cleansing&nbsp; preparation though with the addition of stool and fluid tagging agents. CTC is a considerably less invasive test as compared&nbsp; to&nbsp; optical&nbsp; colonoscopy,&nbsp; as&nbsp; reflected&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complication&nbsp; rate,&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; perforation&nbsp; is&nbsp; 1&nbsp; in&nbsp; 22,000&nbsp; for&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; as&nbsp; opposed&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1,000&nbsp; for&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; [38,39].&nbsp; The &nbsp;rectal&nbsp; tube&nbsp; is&nbsp; only&nbsp; inserted&nbsp; a&nbsp; short distance into the rectum to perform CTC, whereas the colonoscope traverses the entire length of the colon at colonoscopy. Additionally, CTC is performed without sedation, thus foregoing any complications associated with sedation. The&nbsp; American&nbsp; College&nbsp; of&nbsp; Radiology&nbsp; Imaging&nbsp; Network&nbsp; (ACRIN)&nbsp; National&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; Trial&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; largest&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; multicenter&nbsp; trial&nbsp; to&nbsp; date&nbsp; [40].&nbsp; Fifteen&nbsp; sites&nbsp; recruited&nbsp; a&nbsp; total&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2,531&nbsp; asymptomatic&nbsp; patients,&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; multidetector-row CTC (16 rows or more) with stool and fluid tagging and mechanical carbon dioxide insufflation of the colon. All participating radiologists had to complete a qualifying examination, with a minimum accuracy of 90%&nbsp; for&nbsp; large&nbsp; polyps.&nbsp; Per-patient&nbsp; sensitivity,&nbsp; specificity,&nbsp; and&nbsp; positive&nbsp; and&nbsp; negative&nbsp; predictive&nbsp; values&nbsp; were&nbsp; 90%,&nbsp; 86%,&nbsp; 23%,&nbsp; and&nbsp; 99%,&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; for&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; &ge;10-mm&nbsp; adenomas&nbsp; or&nbsp; cancers.&nbsp; The&nbsp; per-patient&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; for&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; adenomas&nbsp; &ge;6&nbsp; mm&nbsp; was&nbsp; 78%.&nbsp; The&nbsp; per-polyp&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; for&nbsp; &ge;10-mm&nbsp; adenomas&nbsp; or&nbsp; cancers&nbsp; was&nbsp; 84%.&nbsp; When comparing primary 2-D and primary 3-D interpretation methods, no difference in sensitivity was identified for the detection of large polyps. In another large study of 1,233 asymptomatic average-risk individuals undergoing colorectal cancer screening, the sensitivities of CTC and colonoscopy for detecting adenomatous polyps &ge;10 mm were 94% and 88%, respectively [41].&nbsp; A&nbsp; trial&nbsp; performed&nbsp; with&nbsp; 307&nbsp; asymptomatic&nbsp; subjects&nbsp; using&nbsp; 64&nbsp; multidetector-row&nbsp; CT&nbsp; demonstrated&nbsp; a&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 93%, respectively, for polyps &ge;6 mm and 92% and 98%, respectively, for polyps &ge;10&nbsp; mm&nbsp; [42].&nbsp; Two&nbsp; meta-analyses&nbsp; of&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; performance&nbsp; in&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; &ge;10-mm&nbsp; polyps&nbsp; showed&nbsp; pooled&nbsp;</p>
<p>sensitivities by patient of 85% and 93%, with pooled specificities of 97% [43,44]. Some older studies have shown poorer&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; (sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 55%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 59%)&nbsp; [45,46].&nbsp; These&nbsp; discrepant&nbsp; results&nbsp; were&nbsp; likely&nbsp; related&nbsp; to&nbsp; differences&nbsp; in&nbsp; study&nbsp; design,&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; reader&nbsp; training,&nbsp; and&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; technique&nbsp; (eg,&nbsp; no&nbsp; fecal&nbsp; tagging)&nbsp; in&nbsp; these&nbsp; older&nbsp; studies. The&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; yields&nbsp; of&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; and&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; for&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; neoplasia&nbsp; have&nbsp; also&nbsp; been&nbsp; compared&nbsp; in&nbsp; parallel&nbsp; screening&nbsp; programs&nbsp; [47].&nbsp; Primary&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; screening&nbsp; in&nbsp; 3,120&nbsp; patients&nbsp; was&nbsp; compared&nbsp; with&nbsp; primary&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; screening&nbsp; in&nbsp; 3,163&nbsp; subjects.&nbsp; Similar&nbsp; detection&nbsp; rates&nbsp; were&nbsp; found&nbsp; for&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; and&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; screening,&nbsp; which&nbsp; identified 123 and 121 advanced neoplasms, respectively. The referral rate for colonoscopy in the CTC group was 8%. The total numbers of polyps removed in the CTC and colonoscopy groups were 561 and 2,434, respectively. Seven&nbsp; perforations&nbsp; occurred&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; group,&nbsp; but&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp; none&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; group.&nbsp; A&nbsp; multi-center&nbsp; randomized trial of 1,610 patients assigned to undergo either colonoscopy (n = 1,072) or CTC (n = 538) found an 11% detection rate for cancers and polyps &ge;10 mm with both techniques [48]. A&nbsp; review&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; 1-year&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; screening&nbsp; experience&nbsp; for&nbsp; colorectal&nbsp; neoplasia&nbsp; showed&nbsp; that&nbsp; 3.9%&nbsp; of&nbsp; individuals&nbsp; had&nbsp; 1&nbsp; polyp &ge;1&nbsp; cm,&nbsp; and&nbsp; 6.9%&nbsp; had&nbsp; &ge;1&nbsp; polyp(s)&nbsp; 6&nbsp; to&nbsp; 9&nbsp; mm&nbsp; [20].&nbsp; Of&nbsp; the&nbsp; 71&nbsp; patients&nbsp; who&nbsp; chose&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; for&nbsp; further&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; polyps,&nbsp; concordant&nbsp; lesions&nbsp; were&nbsp; found&nbsp; with&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; in&nbsp; 65&nbsp; (91.5%&nbsp; positive&nbsp; predictive&nbsp; value)&nbsp; [20].&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition,&nbsp; the&nbsp; outcomes&nbsp; of&nbsp; patients&nbsp; with&nbsp; negative&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; screens&nbsp; have&nbsp; also&nbsp; been&nbsp; reported.&nbsp; A&nbsp; longitudinal&nbsp; follow-up&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1,011&nbsp; patients&nbsp; over&nbsp; nearly&nbsp; 5&nbsp; years&nbsp; demonstrated&nbsp; a&nbsp; single-interval&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; (crude&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; incidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; 0.2&nbsp; cancers&nbsp; per&nbsp; 1,000&nbsp; patient&nbsp; years),&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; 5-year&nbsp; routine&nbsp; screen&nbsp; interval&nbsp; and nonreporting of diminutive lesions (&le;5 mm) were appropriate strategies [49]. CTC performance has been evaluated in senior patient cohorts (&ge;65 years of age). A retrospective analysis of 577 subjects found an excellent CTC concordance rate of 91% [50]. Based on a 6-mm threshold, there was an overall patient&nbsp; referral&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; 15%&nbsp; for&nbsp; colonoscopy.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; only&nbsp; adenomas,&nbsp; the&nbsp; per-patient&nbsp; positivity&nbsp; rates&nbsp; for&nbsp; 6-&nbsp; and&nbsp; 10-mm&nbsp; thresholds&nbsp; were&nbsp; 11%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 7%,&nbsp; respectively.&nbsp; When&nbsp; comparing&nbsp; 204&nbsp; nonsenior&nbsp; (14%)&nbsp; and&nbsp; 250&nbsp; senior&nbsp; patients&nbsp; (13%)&nbsp; undergoing&nbsp; CTC,&nbsp; another&nbsp; study&nbsp; found&nbsp; no&nbsp; statistically&nbsp; significant&nbsp; difference&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; of&nbsp; individuals with at least 1 polyp &ge;6 mm [51]. A post hoc analysis of 477 senior patients from the ACRIN National CTC&nbsp; Trial&nbsp; demonstrated&nbsp; that&nbsp; for&nbsp; large&nbsp; neoplasms,&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; among&nbsp; the&nbsp; older&nbsp; cohort&nbsp; were&nbsp; 82%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 83%,&nbsp; respectively&nbsp; [52].&nbsp; There&nbsp; was&nbsp; no &nbsp;statistically&nbsp; significant&nbsp; difference&nbsp; when&nbsp; compared&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 92%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 86%,&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; for&nbsp; lesions&nbsp; &ge;10&nbsp; mm&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; younger&nbsp; patient&nbsp; cohort.&nbsp; For&nbsp; lesions&nbsp; &gt;6&nbsp; mm,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; were&nbsp; 72%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 86%,&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; for&nbsp; older&nbsp; patients&nbsp; and&nbsp; 81%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 89%,&nbsp; respectively, for younger patients, with no statistically significant difference. Another study reporting outcomes of 1,400 senior patients who underwent CTC found a 15% frequency for referral to colonoscopy at a polyp threshold of 6 mm [53]. Colorectal neoplasia was identified in 9% of patients, and advanced neoplasia was found in 3%. Similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; colonoscopy,&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; supporting&nbsp; serrated&nbsp; polyp&nbsp; detection&nbsp; at&nbsp; CT&nbsp; is&nbsp; emerging.&nbsp; Despite&nbsp; a&nbsp; subtle,&nbsp; flat&nbsp; nature to sessile serrated polyps, these lesions can be detected at CTC likely because of a phenomenon of polyp coating.&nbsp; It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; adherent&nbsp; mucin&nbsp; elaborated&nbsp; by&nbsp; these&nbsp; lesions&nbsp; mix&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; tagging&nbsp; agents &nbsp;to&nbsp; form&nbsp; a&nbsp; contrast coat. In an observational CTC screening study (n = 8,289), CTC demonstrated a prevalence of 3.1% for serrated lesions &ge;6 mm in size. As seen by the colonoscopy experience, these lesions tended to be large (&gt;10 mm in&nbsp; size),&nbsp; flat,&nbsp; and&nbsp; right&nbsp; sided.&nbsp; The&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; coat&nbsp; markedly&nbsp; improved&nbsp; lesion&nbsp; detection&nbsp; with&nbsp; an&nbsp; odds&nbsp; ratio of 40.4 (95% CI, 10.1, 161.4) [54]. Noncathartic CTC also has been assessed in recent years and does not perform as well as conventional CTC. In a prospective&nbsp; study&nbsp; of&nbsp; 605&nbsp; adults&nbsp; at&nbsp; average&nbsp; to&nbsp; moderate&nbsp; risk&nbsp; for&nbsp; colon&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; both&nbsp; laxative-free&nbsp; CTC and colonoscopy, per patient sensitivity and specificity of CTC were 91% and 85% for adenomas &ge;10 mm, 70% and 86% for adenomas &ge;8 mm, and 59% and 88% for adenomas &ge;6 mm [32]. In a prospective study of 564 asymptomatic&nbsp; adults&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; noncathartic&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; with&nbsp; fecal&nbsp; tagging,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensitivity,&nbsp; specificity,&nbsp; negative&nbsp; predictive&nbsp; value,&nbsp; and&nbsp; positive&nbsp; predictive&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; noncathartic&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; for&nbsp; adenomatous&nbsp; polyps&nbsp; or&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; &ge;6&nbsp; mm&nbsp; were 76%, 92%, 98%, and 38%, respectively [55].</p>

<p><strong>X-ray barium enema double-contrast &ndash; DCBE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;DCBE also requires a preprocedural bowel cleansing preparation. The study is performed by administration of a liquid barium-based contrast agent and air-insufflation of the colon via a tube inserted into the rectum. Images are acquired with the patient in different obliquities and at different table angulations ranging from supine to standing. Performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; is&nbsp; dependent&nbsp; on&nbsp; optimal&nbsp; patient&nbsp; positioning&nbsp; because&nbsp; patient&nbsp; anatomy&nbsp; varies.&nbsp; The&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACR Appropriateness Criteria&reg;6 Colorectal Cancer Screening perforation&nbsp; rate&nbsp; during&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; is&nbsp; approximately&nbsp; 1&nbsp; in&nbsp; 25,000&nbsp; [56]&nbsp; as&nbsp; compared&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1&nbsp; in&nbsp; 22,000&nbsp; for&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1,000 for diagnostic colonoscopy [38,39]. The&nbsp; best&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; the&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; comes&nbsp; from&nbsp; studies&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; patients&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; both&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; and&nbsp; endoscopy.&nbsp; In&nbsp; a&nbsp; prospective&nbsp; trial&nbsp; including&nbsp; 614&nbsp; patients,&nbsp; each &nbsp;of&nbsp; whom&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; and&nbsp; colonoscopy,&nbsp; per-patient&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; of&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; were&nbsp; 48%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 90%,&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; for&nbsp; lesions&nbsp; &ge;10 mm&nbsp; and&nbsp; 41%&nbsp; and&nbsp; 82%&nbsp; for&nbsp; lesions&nbsp; &ge;6&nbsp; mm,&nbsp; respectively&nbsp; [46].&nbsp; In&nbsp; an&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; of&nbsp; 190&nbsp; patients&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; DCBE and colonoscopy, overall sensitivity for polyps was 70%, which increased to 80% for polyps &gt;10 mm [57]. In an evaluation of 675 patients who underwent both flexible sigmoidoscopy and DCBE, DCBE missed 35% of polyps 6 to 10 mm and 17% of polyps &gt;11 mm [58]. A&nbsp; retrospective&nbsp; study&nbsp; evaluated&nbsp; the&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; yield&nbsp; of&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; examinations&nbsp; performed&nbsp; for&nbsp; colorectal&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; screening in average-risk individuals &gt;50 years of age [59]. The diagnostic yield was 5.1% for neoplastic lesions &ge;10&nbsp; mm&nbsp; and&nbsp; 6.2%&nbsp; for&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; neoplastic&nbsp; lesions,&nbsp; regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; size.&nbsp; These&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; yields&nbsp; fall&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; range&nbsp; of&nbsp; those&nbsp; reported&nbsp; for&nbsp; screening&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; (5.0%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 9.5%&nbsp; for&nbsp; colonic&nbsp; neoplasms&nbsp; &ge;10&nbsp; mm&nbsp; [60-62] &nbsp;and 4.6% to 11.7% for advanced colonic neoplasms, regardless of size [60,62,63]). Additional data on the effectiveness of the DCBE for detecting colorectal cancer comes from studies in which the imaging&nbsp; history&nbsp; of&nbsp; patients&nbsp; with&nbsp; colorectal&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; was&nbsp; reviewed.&nbsp; In&nbsp; many&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; studies,&nbsp; the&nbsp; risk&nbsp; level&nbsp; of&nbsp; patients&nbsp; undergoing&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; reported.&nbsp; Based&nbsp; on&nbsp; this&nbsp; methodology,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; ranges&nbsp; from&nbsp; 75%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 95%&nbsp; [64-66].&nbsp; This&nbsp; correlates&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; large,&nbsp; population-based&nbsp; study&nbsp; that&nbsp; found&nbsp; the&nbsp; overall&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; new&nbsp; or&nbsp; missed cancers following a DCBE was 22% [67]. A&nbsp; meta-analysis&nbsp; comparing&nbsp; the&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; with&nbsp; CTC&nbsp; for&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; polyps&nbsp; &ge;6&nbsp; mm&nbsp; included&nbsp; 11&nbsp; studies using DCBE (5,995 patients, 1,548 polyps) and 30 studies using CTC (6,573 patients, 2,348 polyps) [68]. Despite the inclusion of CTC studies with older techniques, statistically lower sensitivity and specificity were still seen for the DCBE compared with CTC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SCBE Single-contrast barium enema (SCBE)</strong> studies are performed by administration of liquid barium via a rectal tube. Unlike&nbsp; a&nbsp; DCBE,&nbsp; the&nbsp; colon&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; insufflated&nbsp; with&nbsp; air.&nbsp; SCBE&nbsp; studies&nbsp; are&nbsp; generally&nbsp; performed&nbsp; when&nbsp; patients&nbsp; are&nbsp; unable to tolerate a DCBE (eg, patients unable to stand upright) and a CTC cannot be performed. A&nbsp; preponderance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; literature&nbsp; has&nbsp; demonstrated&nbsp; a&nbsp; markedly&nbsp; inferior&nbsp; performance&nbsp; profile&nbsp; for&nbsp; SCBE.&nbsp; A&nbsp; retrospective&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; of&nbsp; 139&nbsp; patients&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; barium&nbsp; enema&nbsp; and&nbsp; had&nbsp; 1&nbsp; or&nbsp; more&nbsp; colonic&nbsp; polyps&nbsp; diagnosed endoscopically found sensitivity of SCBE for polyps &lt;1 cm to be 72% and for polyps &ge;1 cm to be 94% [69].&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; study,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; was&nbsp; 88%&nbsp; for&nbsp; polyps&nbsp; &lt;1&nbsp; cm&nbsp; and&nbsp; 96%&nbsp; for&nbsp; polyps&nbsp; &ge;1&nbsp; cm&nbsp; [69].&nbsp; Patient risk level was not reported in this study. A&nbsp; minority&nbsp; of&nbsp; studies&nbsp; have&nbsp; suggested&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; SCBE&nbsp; has&nbsp; the&nbsp; potential&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; as&nbsp; sensitive&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; DCBE&nbsp; for&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; cancer and large polyps. The reported sensitivity for cancer ranges from 82% to 95% [65,66] and is approximately 95% for large polyps [69]. In a retrospective evaluation of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer who had undergone a prior DCBE or SCBE, the cancer miss rate was 4.8% for SCBE and 4.7% for DCBE [65]. However, because&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; paucity&nbsp; of&nbsp; studies&nbsp; and&nbsp; limitations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; study&nbsp; designs,&nbsp; questions&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; raised&nbsp; about&nbsp; the&nbsp; reproducibility of the results, particularly for large polyps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MR Colonography Magnetic resonance (MR)</strong></p>
<p>colonography for colorectal cancer screening is generally considered an investigational test&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; and&nbsp; has&nbsp; not&nbsp; been&nbsp; adequately&nbsp; validated&nbsp; as&nbsp; an&nbsp; acceptable&nbsp; test&nbsp; for&nbsp; colorectal&nbsp; cancer&nbsp; screening.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; high-resolution&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; is&nbsp; possible&nbsp; with&nbsp; MR&nbsp; techniques,&nbsp; acquisition&nbsp; times&nbsp; are&nbsp; longer&nbsp; as&nbsp; compared to CT imaging, leading to a tradeoff between high resolution and long acquisition time (with resultant motion&nbsp; degradation)&nbsp; with&nbsp; currently&nbsp; available&nbsp; technology.&nbsp; Optimal&nbsp; technique&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; source&nbsp; of&nbsp; active&nbsp; investigation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; distention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; colon&nbsp; with&nbsp; liquid&nbsp; (a&nbsp; diluted&nbsp; gadolinium&nbsp; solution&nbsp; for&nbsp; &ldquo;bright&nbsp; lumen&rdquo;&nbsp; T1-weighted&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; [70,71]&nbsp; or&nbsp; tap&nbsp; water&nbsp; for&nbsp; &ldquo;dark&nbsp; lumen&rdquo;&nbsp; T1-weighted&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; [72,73]),&nbsp; air&nbsp; insufflation&nbsp; without&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; cleansing&nbsp; [74], and administration of intravenous contrast material have been evaluated [75]. With current techniques, MR colonography does not perform as well as CTC for detection of polyps, especially for&nbsp; small&nbsp; lesions.&nbsp; Fewer&nbsp; published&nbsp; studies&nbsp; are&nbsp; available&nbsp; evaluating&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; as&nbsp; compared&nbsp; to&nbsp; CTC,&nbsp; and&nbsp; sample&nbsp; sizes&nbsp; are&nbsp; generally&nbsp; small&nbsp; for&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; studies,&nbsp; which&nbsp; remains&nbsp; primarily&nbsp; an&nbsp; investigational&nbsp; technique.&nbsp; In&nbsp; a&nbsp; systematic&nbsp; review&nbsp; of&nbsp; 13&nbsp; prospective&nbsp; studies&nbsp; evaluating&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; performance&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1,285</p>
<p>patients,&nbsp; including&nbsp; asymptomatic&nbsp; patients&nbsp; at&nbsp; average&nbsp; risk&nbsp; and&nbsp; symptomatic&nbsp; patients&nbsp; at&nbsp; increased&nbsp; risk,&nbsp; the&nbsp; per-patient sensitivity and specificity for polyps &ge;10 mm were 88% and 99%, respectively [76]. On a per-polyp basis, polyps&nbsp; of&nbsp; &ge;10&nbsp; mm&nbsp; were&nbsp; detected&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 84%.&nbsp; The&nbsp; data&nbsp; were&nbsp; found&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; too&nbsp; heterogeneous&nbsp; for&nbsp; diminutive polyps &lt;6 mm and for small polyps measuring 6 to 9 mm. In&nbsp; a&nbsp; study&nbsp; of&nbsp; 286&nbsp; asymptomatic&nbsp; individuals&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; both&nbsp; 3T&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; and&nbsp; colonoscopy&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same day, sensitivity and specificity of MR colonography for adenomas &ge;6 mm were 78% and 95%, respectively [77]. In an evaluation of 46 patients (screening and asymptomatic) who underwent MR colonography followed by colonoscopy,&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; was&nbsp; 67%&nbsp; sensitive&nbsp; and&nbsp; 96%&nbsp; specific&nbsp; for&nbsp; polyp&nbsp; detection &nbsp;on&nbsp; a&nbsp; per-patient&nbsp; basis&nbsp; [75] and was 100% sensitive (4/4) and 100% specific (20/20) for lesions 6 to 9 mm [75]. In a smaller pilot study of&nbsp; 29&nbsp; patients&nbsp; who&nbsp; underwent&nbsp; both&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; performed&nbsp; with&nbsp; barium&nbsp; fecal&nbsp; tagging&nbsp; and&nbsp; air&nbsp; distention&nbsp; followed&nbsp; by&nbsp; colonoscopy,&nbsp; for&nbsp; &ge;10-mm&nbsp; lesions,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; of&nbsp; MR&nbsp; colonography&nbsp; were&nbsp; 44&nbsp; and&nbsp; 100%, respectively. However, for 5- to 9-mm lesions, specificity was 95% but sensitivity was only 6% [74]. The risk level of patients was not reported</p>
