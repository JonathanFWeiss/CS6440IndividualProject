<p><strong>CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, CT enterography, or MR enterography is usually appropriate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MRI abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast, CT abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, Fluoroscopy small-bowel follow-through , MRI abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, or US abdomen and pelvis &nbsp;may be appropriate. </strong></p>
<p><strong>CT abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast is usually not appropriate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In&nbsp; this&nbsp; clinical&nbsp; variant,&nbsp; the&nbsp; patient&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; known to&nbsp; have&nbsp; an&nbsp; established&nbsp; diagnosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; CD.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; there are differential diagnostic possibilities, CD is determined to be one of the leading causes for the patient&rsquo;s condition. In this clinical scenario, the patient can present with a range of severity from an indolent presentation in which theindividual&nbsp; is&nbsp; relatively&nbsp; well&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; acutely&nbsp; ill one&nbsp; with&nbsp; severe pain,&nbsp; leukocytosis,&nbsp; vomiting,&nbsp; and/or&nbsp; diarrhea.&nbsp; Theindividual&nbsp; may&nbsp; or&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; able to&nbsp; tolerate the&nbsp; large amounts&nbsp; of&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; needed&nbsp; for&nbsp; specialized&nbsp; imagingprotocols (ie, enterography or enteroclysis techniques) depending on the severity of presentation. In cases in which the patient cannot tolerate the oral contrast requirements, enterography or enteroclysis by CT or MR would then notbe possible options.</p>
<p><strong>CT Enterography</strong></p>
<p>CT enterography represents a CT examination with a specialized protocol. Neutral contrast by mouth is given in large amounts&nbsp; over&nbsp; a&nbsp; set&nbsp; time&nbsp; to&nbsp; promote&nbsp; optimal distention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; [19-21].&nbsp; Combined with&nbsp; othertechnical modifications, including thin collimation, multiplanar reconstruction, and intravenous (IV)&nbsp; contrast, thisprotocol maximizes the technique to depict inflammatory changes in the small bowel related to CD [20,22,23].</p>
<p>It is difficult to precisely determine the&nbsp; test characteristics in CD&nbsp; exactly because of the lack of a true referencestandard.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; overall&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; performance&nbsp; for CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; is&nbsp; excellent.&nbsp; When&nbsp; an&nbsp; endoscopicstandard&nbsp; is&nbsp; utilized, sensitivity&nbsp; for CD&nbsp; ranges from&nbsp; 75%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 90%,&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; of&nbsp; &gt;90%&nbsp; [24-27].&nbsp; Comparedwith &nbsp;other&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; modalities, CT&nbsp; enterography represents an&nbsp; optimal&nbsp; option for&nbsp; most&nbsp; patients&nbsp; [21,27-31].&nbsp; Thediagnosis of acute inflammation is made through visualization of thickened small bowel with mural stratificationas well as extraenteric processes including engorged vasa recti/vasculature and surrounding inflammatory stranding[25,26,32-34].&nbsp; Because CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; cross-sectional&nbsp; imaging modality,&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; for alternativediagnoses, as well for the possible complications of CD including obstruction, abscess, and fistula, can be made[28,35-37].&nbsp; With&nbsp; its&nbsp; intrinsic&nbsp; high spatial&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; and&nbsp; reproducible&nbsp; quality,&nbsp; state-of-the-art&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography represents one of the main imaging methods for initial diagnosis of small-bowel CD. At many United States medicalcenters and practices, a combination of CT enterography and ileocolonoscopy has been advocated as the diagnosticalgorithm of choice at initial presentation [38]. Ileocolonoscopy can assess for colonic and distal ileal involvementandpermits biopsies. The addition of CT enterography allows for assessment of the entire small bowel, including the distal ileum, and is helpful in establishing a CD diagnosis in cases in which the terminal ileum and colon are not involved or when intramural disease is predominant, which may not be apparent at endoscopy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this variant in which the patient does not have an established diagnosis for CD and other entities remain in thedifferential, the&nbsp; cross-sectional/global&nbsp; nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; CT-based&nbsp; modality&nbsp; allows potential diagnosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; entitymimicking a CD presentation and adds to the utility of CT enterography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; to&nbsp; select&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography versus a&nbsp; standard&nbsp; CT&nbsp; abdomen&nbsp; and&nbsp; pelvis&nbsp; examination&nbsp; is dependent on the acuity and severity of presentation. For more indolent presentations in which the patient is able to tolerate large volumes of oral contrast, CT enterography is preferred because it&nbsp;&nbsp; is can detect more subtle findingsof CD compared with a standard CT with positive oral contrast. In contrast, in the acute presentation in which thepatient&nbsp; is&nbsp; severely&nbsp; ill&nbsp; and&nbsp; unable&nbsp; to&nbsp; tolerate the&nbsp; large volume&nbsp; requirements,&nbsp; a&nbsp; standard&nbsp; CT&nbsp; (without&nbsp; or&nbsp; with&nbsp; oralcontrast) may be the preferred choice. Presumably, any findings of CD would not be subtle in this situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CT Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Standard&nbsp; abdomen&nbsp; and&nbsp; pelvis&nbsp; CT&nbsp; with&nbsp; IV&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; routine&nbsp; protocol&nbsp; (ie,&nbsp; without&nbsp; neutral&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrast enterography technique)&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; useful&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; initial presentation&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; patient&nbsp; with&nbsp; CD&nbsp; without&nbsp; a&nbsp; known prior diagnosis, particularly in the instance of an acutely ill&nbsp;&nbsp; individual who may be unable to tolerate large amounts of oral contrast for an enterography protocol. Standard CT also allows for alternative diagnoses that may mimic CD such as appendicitis in this variant. This adds to the potential utility of this modality for this variant. However, if the&nbsp; patient&nbsp; is&nbsp; able to&nbsp; tolerate&nbsp; the&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; requirements&nbsp; of&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography,&nbsp; optimizing&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; technique improves examination performance over standard CT and should be preferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although standard abdomen and pelvis CT can be done either with or without the administration of IV contrast, it is evident that many of the processes, such as mural enhancement associated with CD require IV contrast for optimal assessment.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; IV&nbsp; contrast,&nbsp; such&nbsp; processes can&nbsp; only&nbsp; be&nbsp; inferred&nbsp; by&nbsp; associated&nbsp; findings,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as wall thickening, which may not occur in mild inflammation. In fact, the importance of contrast can be underscored by the&nbsp; emphasis&nbsp; on determining&nbsp; the&nbsp; optimal timing&nbsp; of&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; following&nbsp; IV&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; administration&nbsp; as opposed&nbsp; to comparisons between IV contrast and noncontrast CT [22]. A prior meta-analysis that evaluated CT performanceincluded studies that were all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conducted with IV contrast [25]. There is a clear consensus that noncontrast CT holdspoorer performance compared against a CT with IV contrast.</p>
<p>Standard&nbsp; CT&nbsp; abdomen and pelvis&nbsp; with&nbsp; IV&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; can&nbsp; provide&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; inflammation&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; affectedgastrointestinal segment. Although there may be less than optimal bowel distention with positive luminal contrast(compared with volume loading techniques) and positive contrast may obscure subtle stratified mural enhancementand&nbsp; more&nbsp; subtle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas of&nbsp; active inflammation, CT&nbsp; with&nbsp; positive&nbsp; luminal contrast&nbsp; can&nbsp; identify&nbsp; wall&nbsp; thickening,luminal narrowing, and adjacent inflammatory changes that may be seen in CD [39]. In addition to assessing forinflammation, standard CT with IV contrast can also evaluate for CD complications, including bowel obstruction,fistula&nbsp; formation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; abscess formation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; positive&nbsp; luminal contrast&nbsp; is&nbsp; preferable to&nbsp; no oral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; in&nbsp; thisscenario.&nbsp; Sensitivities&nbsp; for CT-based&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; for&nbsp; stenosis/obstruction&nbsp; range&nbsp; from&nbsp; 85%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 94%&nbsp; with&nbsp; very&nbsp; high specificities [40,41]. Sensitivities for abscesses are also very good, ranging from 86% to 100% [27,36]. There is more variable performance for fistula detection with sensitivities ranging from 68% to 100% [27,40,42]. One studyshowed&nbsp; a&nbsp; very&nbsp; low&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 20%&nbsp; for enteroenteric fistulas&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; series&nbsp; [40].&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; acute setting,standard CT with IV contrast is a suitable option for assessment. On the other hand, if the patient is relatively welland&nbsp; able to&nbsp; tolerate the&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; requirements&nbsp; of&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography,&nbsp; the&nbsp; optimized&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; protocol&nbsp; increasessensitivity for more subtle inflammation.</p>
<p><strong>CT Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>CT enteroclysis is a CT-based examination in which a nasoduodenal tube is placed to allow controlled distentionof&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel.&nbsp; Typically,&nbsp; neutral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; is&nbsp; continuously&nbsp; infused&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; during CT,&nbsp; and&nbsp; IVcontrast is also given. This procedure typically allows for better distention of the small bowel compared with oralingestion at CT enterography [43,44]. Because of the active infusion, stenoses are more readily determined [43].</p>
<p>There have been few studies evaluating performance in recent years. Although bowel distention of the jejunum is improved with&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enteroclysis,&nbsp; the&nbsp; distention&nbsp; at&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; is&nbsp; considered&nbsp; acceptable [17,18],&nbsp; and&nbsp; CTenterography&nbsp; has been&nbsp; more&nbsp; generally utilized&nbsp; over CT&nbsp; enteroclysis because the&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; is&nbsp; better&nbsp; tolerated&nbsp; bypatients. As with all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imaging modalities, it&nbsp;&nbsp; is difficult to precisely determine the test characteristics in CD exactlybecause of the lack of a true reference standard. However, the overall diagnostic performance for CT enteroclysisis&nbsp; excellent&nbsp; (ie,&nbsp; &gt;85%&nbsp; sensitivity,&nbsp; &gt;90%&nbsp; specificity)&nbsp; [45-47],&nbsp; and&nbsp; this&nbsp; examination&nbsp; has been&nbsp; used&nbsp; as a&nbsp; referencestandard&nbsp; for other&nbsp; modalities&nbsp; in&nbsp; various&nbsp; studies [41,47].&nbsp; The&nbsp; diagnosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; acute inflammation&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; through visualization&nbsp; of&nbsp; thickened&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; with&nbsp; mural&nbsp; stratification&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; extraenteric&nbsp; processes,&nbsp; includingengorged vasa recti/vascular and surrounding inflammatory stranding [43,44]. Because CT enteroclysis is a cross-sectional imaging modality, assessment for alternative diagnoses as well as for the possible complications of CD, including obstruction, abscess, and fistula, can be made [43]. Although the bowel optimization at CT enteroclysisallows excellent&nbsp; examination&nbsp; performance,&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; highest-performing&nbsp; modalities, CT&nbsp; enteroclysis is&nbsp; nottypically suitable in the acute setting in which the patient is ill. It is not uncommon that they cannot tolerate therequirements of this somewhat invasive examination. In a scenario in which the CD is a diagnostic considerationamong others&nbsp; without&nbsp; a&nbsp; prior&nbsp; established&nbsp; diagnosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; disease,&nbsp; the&nbsp; discomfort&nbsp; and&nbsp; risks of duodenal&nbsp; intubation and&nbsp; active contrast&nbsp; infusion often&nbsp; outweighs&nbsp; the&nbsp; increased&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; performance&nbsp; gained,arguing against its use in this situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MR Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>MR enteroclysis is a MR-based examination in which a nasoduodenal tube is placed to allow controlled distentionof the small bowel. Typically, biphasic enteral contrast (low signal on T1 and high signal on T2) is infused overtime prior to MRI, and IV contrast is given during the MR examination. The technical demands of this more invasiveexamination are greater but typically allow for better distention of the small bowel compared with oral ingestionwith an enterography technique [48].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have&nbsp; been&nbsp; few studies evaluating&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; technique&nbsp; in&nbsp; recent&nbsp; years because it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a&nbsp; widelyutilized&nbsp; examination.&nbsp; Although bowel&nbsp; distention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; jejunum&nbsp; is&nbsp; typically&nbsp; less at&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; than&nbsp; withenteroclysis, distention achieved with enterography is considered acceptable [17] and has been more widely utilizedcompared&nbsp; with&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enteroclysis.&nbsp; As with&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imaging&nbsp; modalities, it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; difficult&nbsp; to&nbsp; precisely&nbsp; determine the&nbsp; testcharacteristics in&nbsp; CD&nbsp; exactly&nbsp; because&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; true&nbsp; reference standard.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; overall&nbsp; diagnosticperformance for MR&nbsp; enteroclysis is&nbsp; excellent&nbsp; and&nbsp; at&nbsp; least&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; [49].&nbsp; One comparisonstudy between these two modalities demonstrated statistically better detection of superficial mucosal abnormalitiesover&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; but&nbsp; no&nbsp; difference for stenoses and&nbsp; fistulas&nbsp; [50].&nbsp; Although the&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; optimization&nbsp; at&nbsp; MRenteroclysis allows excellent&nbsp; examination&nbsp; performance,&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; the highest-performing modalities, MRenteroclysis is not typically suitable in the acute setting in which the patient is ill. Often, they cannot tolerate therequirements&nbsp; related&nbsp; to&nbsp; placement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; nasoduodenal&nbsp; tube&nbsp; and&nbsp; active infusion&nbsp; of&nbsp; contrast.&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition,&nbsp; theevaluation for alternative diagnoses mimicking CD may be more difficult or limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MR Enterography</strong></p>
<p>MR enterography combines contrast-enhanced MRI scanning using fast imaging techniques with an enterographyprotocol to optimize bowel distension [38]. As described with CT enterography, this requires the patient to ingest a large volume of oral contrast in a set time. Additionally, the use of glucagon or prone imaging may help to decreasebowel peristalsis and thus artifact. MR enterography holds excellent test performance characteristics (see below)equivalent to other optimized modalities, such as CT enterography. The ability to diagnose alternative diagnosesmay be decreased in cases when a CT-based option may be preferable, depending on the level of patient acuity andability to hold still. Severely ill patients are less likely to be able to hold still for the duration of MRI examination,leading to increased artifact and poorer image quality. In addition, if ill, the patient may not be able to tolerate therequired large volumes of contrast required at MR enterography.</p>
<p>MR&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; can&nbsp; accurately&nbsp; display&nbsp; bowel-wall&nbsp; changes in&nbsp; early&nbsp; CD&nbsp; [51-54].&nbsp; Characteristic bowel-wallchanges suggesting active inflammation&nbsp; include&nbsp; bowel-wall&nbsp; thickening,&nbsp; high&nbsp; T2&nbsp; mural&nbsp; signal,&nbsp; mural&nbsp; hyperenhancement with mural stratification, and hyperemic vasa recta [55-64]. MR cine imaging is potentially useful,allowing for assessment of decreased bowel motility in the affected segments with CD [65]. Besides inflammation,MRI can detect complications for CD, including obstruction, abscess, or fistula. MRI may also depict alternativediagnoses&nbsp; such&nbsp; as appendicitis,&nbsp; although this&nbsp; may be&nbsp; more&nbsp; difficult than&nbsp; at&nbsp; CT.&nbsp; Similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography,&nbsp; theperformance of MR enterography for CD is very good. Rates of sensitivity and specificity are 77% to 82% and 80%to 100%, respectively [24,66,67], and test performance characteristics for active inflammation and complicationsare similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; [27,28,35,40,68,69].&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; quality&nbsp; of&nbsp; MRI examinations&nbsp; is&nbsp; much&nbsp; morevariable and is dependent on patients&rsquo; ability to hold still, leading to increased interobserver variation as opposedto CT enterography [27,35,70-72]. Overall, MRI is more prone to respiratory and bowel-motion artifact, despite theuse of&nbsp; glucagon,&nbsp; which&nbsp; may&nbsp; lead&nbsp; to&nbsp; suboptimal&nbsp; examinations&nbsp; and&nbsp; more&nbsp; difficult interpretations,&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; in acutely ill patients. Because of these limitations, it is best to start with a CT enterography as the initial evaluationin suspected CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MRI Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Standard MRI with a routine protocol (ie, MRI without and with IV contrast and without oral contrast enterography technique)&nbsp; can&nbsp; detect&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; CD&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; patient cannot&nbsp; tolerate&nbsp; large volumes&nbsp; of&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; (ie,&nbsp; acutely&nbsp; ill patients). &nbsp;However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; optimization&nbsp; technique&nbsp; decreases evaluation&nbsp; of&nbsp; more&nbsp; subtle&nbsp; findings.&nbsp; One study (n = 100) reported a sensitivity of 50% to 86% and specificity of 93% to 94% for wall thickening [73]. Thus, standard MR may be an option when oral contrast requirements at enterography cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>For&nbsp; CD&nbsp; complications,&nbsp; the&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; ability&nbsp; of&nbsp; MRI&nbsp; is&nbsp; similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; standard&nbsp; CT&nbsp; with&nbsp; IV&nbsp; with&nbsp; similar&nbsp; reported sensitivities and specificities in various&nbsp; series&nbsp; [27,40,58,72]. The sensitivity for stenosis/obstruction ranges from87%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 92%&nbsp; with&nbsp; high specificities;&nbsp; detection&nbsp; performance&nbsp; remains&nbsp; high for abscesses,&nbsp; with&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; ranging from 86% to 100%. As with CT, the detection for fistulas is more variable, ranging from 40% to 100%. Because of the&nbsp; superior&nbsp; soft-tissue contrast,&nbsp; perianal&nbsp; disease including&nbsp; fistulation&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; perineum&nbsp; is&nbsp; best&nbsp; evaluated&nbsp; at&nbsp; MRI,using a small field of view and focused examination [74-76].</p>
<p><strong>Radiography Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>Radiographs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; abdomen are limited&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; initial diagnosis&nbsp; for CD.&nbsp; The&nbsp; ability&nbsp; to&nbsp; directly&nbsp; visualize bowelpathology is limited, and evidence for CD is instead inferred indirectly. Radiographs may be useful in severely ill presenting patients to evaluate for the presence of bowel perforation or obstruction</p>
<p><strong>Fluoroscopy Small-Bowel Follow-Through and Fluoroscopic Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>Historically, fluoroscopic contrast examinations of the gastrointestinal tract have been the primary imaging methodsof choice in the diagnosis of CD.Small-bowel follow-through (SBFT; with or without per oral pneumocolon) andenteroclysis can&nbsp; be&nbsp; used&nbsp; to&nbsp; evaluate the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; for evidence of&nbsp; thickening and&nbsp; active disease [50,79].&nbsp; In addition, internal fistulas can be detected [80], although other extramural complications, such as abscess formation, are only indirectly visualized, which leads to decreased detection [27]. It has become evident; however, with theemergence of specialized cross-sectional imaging modalities, that the performance of contrast fluoroscopy is not as accurate for active disease as compared to these other examinations [18,42,46,81,82]. Both SBFT and enteroclysisare hampered by their 2-D perspective, whereby pathology can be obscured because of overlapping bowel loops[18,82,83]. On the other hand, the real-time assessment for a fixed versus pliable nature of a segment of bowel canprovide important ancillary information. Depending on institutional and surgeon preference, there may be a role in delineating the preoperative anatomy for the surgeon, although there has been a marked decline in fluoroscopic useover recent years.In&nbsp; addition,&nbsp; fluoroscopic&nbsp; examinations&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; tolerated&nbsp; in&nbsp; acutely&nbsp; ill patients because&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrastrequirements for these procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fluoroscopy Contrast Enema</strong></p>
<p>Colonoscopy is the preferred initial examination of the colon in patients suspected of having inflammatory boweldisease&nbsp; primarily&nbsp; involving&nbsp; the&nbsp; colon as&nbsp; opposed to&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; [9].&nbsp; Colonoscopy is&nbsp; superior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; bariumenema&nbsp; for the&nbsp; detection&nbsp; of&nbsp; early&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; changes and&nbsp; has largely&nbsp; replaced&nbsp; it as the&nbsp; initial diagnosticexamination [9]. Particularly in an acutely ill&nbsp;&nbsp; patient, a contrast enema may be technically challenging because of the need for retrograde contrast instillation.</p>
<p><strong>US Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Transabdominal ultrasound (US) is a potential effective option in the initial diagnosis of CD [84,85]. The techniquerequires a systematic survey pattern of the entire bowel with graded compression (ie, overlapping vertical sweepswith a high-frequency 5&ndash;17 MHz linear transducer) [11]. Sensitivities for disease detection range from 75% to 94%,with&nbsp; specificities of&nbsp; 67%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 100%&nbsp; for CD&nbsp; with&nbsp; demonstration of&nbsp; wall&nbsp; thickening&nbsp; [66,86-88].&nbsp; The&nbsp; threshold forabnormal&nbsp; thickening is&nbsp; typically&nbsp; set&nbsp; at&nbsp; 4&nbsp; mm.&nbsp; Besides wall&nbsp; thickening,&nbsp; findings&nbsp; include&nbsp; alteration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; US&nbsp; gut signature,&nbsp; presence of&nbsp; fat&nbsp; wrapping,&nbsp; and&nbsp; vascular&nbsp; changes [89-92].&nbsp; US&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; and&nbsp; Doppler&nbsp; techniques&nbsp; appear helpful in determining inflammation [93-95]. In addition, the real-time assessment of bowel pliability and peristalsiscan&nbsp; be&nbsp; helpful&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; evaluation.&nbsp; Transperineal&nbsp; or&nbsp; endoanal&nbsp; US&nbsp; is&nbsp; also&nbsp; helpful&nbsp; at&nbsp; assessing&nbsp; perianalfistulous disease related to CD [96].</p>
<p><strong>HMPAO WBC Scan</strong></p>
<p>Leucoscintigraphy&nbsp; or&nbsp; Tc-99m-hexamethyl&nbsp; propylene&nbsp; amine&nbsp; oxime-labeled&nbsp; white&nbsp; blood cell&nbsp; (Tc-99m&nbsp; HMPAOWBC) scan have demonstrated good sensitivities and specificities for intestinal inflammation in the 79% to 85%and 81% to 98% range, respectively [98]. Proponents contend that leucoscintigraphy is useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of activity of extent of disease [99] with performance results equivalent to cross-sectional imaging [28].However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; disadvantages of&nbsp; this&nbsp; examination,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as the&nbsp; decreased&nbsp; ability&nbsp; to&nbsp; depict&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; detect alternative&nbsp; diagnoses&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; complicated&nbsp; time-consuming technical&nbsp; aspects (ie,&nbsp; labeling&nbsp; and&nbsp; handling of&nbsp; bloodproducts) have limited its use in initial diagnosis. Furthermore, leucoscintigraphy is limited in alternative diagnoses mimicking CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp; addition&nbsp; of&nbsp; metabolic&nbsp; information&nbsp; from&nbsp; PET with&nbsp; the&nbsp; morphologic&nbsp; anatomic imaging&nbsp; of&nbsp; CT&nbsp; or&nbsp; MR&nbsp; shows promise. It may be helpful to better assess the level of active inflammation from fibrosis [100,101]. Studies alsoshow improved assessment in the colon in a murine animal model [102], which points to potential future usefulness because the colon is less well evaluated at both CT enterography and MR enterography. At this point, there are fewlarge-series published clinical studies but small series show promising results [103,104].</p>
