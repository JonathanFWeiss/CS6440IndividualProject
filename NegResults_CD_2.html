<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, CT enterography, or MR enterography is usually appropriate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MRI abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast, CT abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, Fluoroscopy small-bowel follow-through , MRI abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, or US abdomen and pelvis &nbsp;may be appropriate. </strong></p>
<p><strong>CT abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast is usually not appropriate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In this clinical variant, there is an established diagnosis of CD. Here, the patient presents with acute worsening of symptoms attributable to known disease. The concern is for an active flare or for the development of a complicationof CD (ie, obstruction, abscess, fistula development). The clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis mimickingCD is low.</p>
<p><strong>CT Enterography</strong></p>
<p>CT enterography represents a CT examination with a specialized protocol. Neutral contrast by mouth is given in large amounts over a set time period to promote optimal distention of the small bowel [19-21]. Combined with othertechnical&nbsp; modifications,&nbsp; including thin&nbsp; collimation, multiplanar&nbsp; reconstruction,&nbsp; and&nbsp; IV&nbsp; contrast,&nbsp; this&nbsp; protocolmaximizes the technique to depict inflammatory changes in the small bowel related to CD [20,22,23].</p>
<p>CT enterography is well suited to evaluate a potential acute flare or complication of CD. However, if the patientcannot tolerate the contrast requirements of the enterography technique, standard CT may be an option (althoughless sensitive, the findings of an acute flare are likely not subtle if the patient is acutely ill and unable to tolerate thecontrast volume of CT enterography). The overall diagnostic performance for CT enterography is excellent. Whenan endoscopic standard is utilized, sensitivity for CD ranges from 75% to 90%, with a specificity of &gt;90% [24-27]. The&nbsp; diagnosis&nbsp; of&nbsp; acute&nbsp; inflammation&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; through visualization&nbsp; of&nbsp; thickened&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; with&nbsp; muralstratification, as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; extraenteric processes that&nbsp; include&nbsp; engorged vasa recti/vasculature and&nbsp; surroundinginflammatory stranding [25,26,32-34]. Because CT enterography is a cross-sectional imaging modality, assessmentfor the possible complications of CD, including obstruction, abscess, and fistula, can be made similar to the abilityof standard CT abdomen and pelvis [28,35-37].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision to select CT enterography versus a standard CT abdomen and pelvis is dependent on theability to tolerate the oral contrast requirements of CT enterography. CT enterography is more sensitive for bowelchanges related to CD than standard CT given the oral contrast optimization. However, the findings of CD in an acute flare are often not subtle and can be seen at standard CT. In addition, the complications including abscess or fistula formation may be easier seen at standard CT with positive oral contrast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CT Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Standard abdomen and pelvis CT with IV contrast with a routine protocol (ie, without oral contrast enterographytechnique) can be useful in the suspected exacerbation of CD. Although the imaging findings of an acute flare in a known CD&nbsp; patient&nbsp; are typically&nbsp; not&nbsp; subtle&nbsp; (ie,&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; situation&nbsp; of&nbsp; subtle&nbsp; mucosal&nbsp; enhancement&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; clinicallyasymptomatic patient undergoing treatment monitoring), optimizing the bowel by enterography technique leads to improved detection of inflammation and should be pursued if the patient can tolerate the oral contrast. On the otherhand,&nbsp; CT&nbsp; with&nbsp; positive&nbsp; luminal contrast&nbsp; (without&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; technique)&nbsp; can&nbsp; identify&nbsp; wall&nbsp; thickening,&nbsp; luminalnarrowing,&nbsp; and&nbsp; adjacent&nbsp; inflammatory&nbsp; changes that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; seen&nbsp; in&nbsp; CD&nbsp; [19].&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition,&nbsp; the&nbsp; complications&nbsp; of abscess formation or fistula formation can be detected at standard IV contrast CT in which the positive oral contrastmay&nbsp; improve&nbsp; detection&nbsp; of&nbsp; complications.&nbsp; Sensitivities&nbsp; for abscesses are very&nbsp; good,&nbsp; ranging from&nbsp; 86%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 100% [27,36].&nbsp; There is&nbsp; more&nbsp; variable performance for fistula&nbsp; detection&nbsp; with&nbsp; sensitivities&nbsp; ranging from&nbsp; 68%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 100%[27,40,42]. One study showed a very low sensitivity of 20% for enteroenteric fistulas in their series [40].</p>
<p>Although standard abdomen and pelvis CT can be done either with or without the administration of IV contrast, it is evident that many of the processes seen with an acute flare in CD require IV contrast for optimal assessment.Without IV contrast, such processes can only be inferred by associated findings, such as wall thickening. In fact,the&nbsp; importance of&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; underscored&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; emphasis on determining the&nbsp; optimal&nbsp; timing&nbsp; of&nbsp; imaging following IV contrast administration as opposed to comparisons between IV contrast and noncontrast CT [22]. A prior meta-analysis that evaluated CT performance included studies that were all conducted with IV contrast [25]. There is clear consensus that noncontrast CT holds poorer performance compared against a CT with IV contrast.</p>
<p><strong>CT Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>CT enteroclysis is a CT-based examination in which a nasoduodenal tube is placed to allow controlled distentionof&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel.&nbsp; Typically,&nbsp; neutral&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; is&nbsp; continuously&nbsp; infused&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; small&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; during CT,&nbsp; and&nbsp; IVcontrast is also administered. This procedure typically allows for better distention of the small bowel compared withoral&nbsp; ingestion&nbsp; at&nbsp; CT&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; [43,44].&nbsp; Because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; active infusion,&nbsp; stenoses are more&nbsp; readily&nbsp; determined[43].</p>
<p>The overall diagnostic performance for CT enteroclysis is excellent (ie, &gt;85% sensitivity, &gt;90% specificity) [45-47],&nbsp; and &nbsp;this&nbsp; examination&nbsp; has been&nbsp; used&nbsp; as a&nbsp; reference standard&nbsp; for other&nbsp; modalities&nbsp; in&nbsp; various&nbsp; studies [41,47]. However, it&nbsp;&nbsp; is important to remember that detection of subtle evidence for CD is not needed in this clinical variantin which the patient is presenting acutely with a suspected flare or complication. Similar to other CT-based options,the&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; for the&nbsp; possible&nbsp; complications&nbsp; of&nbsp; CD,&nbsp; including&nbsp; obstruction,&nbsp; abscess,&nbsp; and&nbsp; fistula,&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; madebecause&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; underlying&nbsp; cross-sectional&nbsp; nature&nbsp; without&nbsp; additional advantage from&nbsp; the&nbsp; dedicated&nbsp; enteroclysis protocol</p>
<p>In this specific variant, CT enteroclysis may be limited because it is dependent on the clinical acuity or severity of presentation.&nbsp; With&nbsp; a&nbsp; significant&nbsp; acute flare&nbsp; or&nbsp; complication,&nbsp; the&nbsp; patient&nbsp; would poorly&nbsp; tolerate CT&nbsp; enteroclysis because of the marked demands on the patient related to the placement of the nasoduodenal tube and need for activeinfusion of&nbsp; oral&nbsp; contrast.&nbsp; Here,&nbsp; the&nbsp; risks&nbsp; outweigh the&nbsp; added&nbsp; benefits of&nbsp; optimized&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; visualization,&nbsp; and&nbsp; thisimaging choice should be&nbsp; avoided when&nbsp; acutely&nbsp; ill. If,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; the&nbsp; patient&nbsp; is&nbsp; relatively&nbsp; asymptomatic,&nbsp; CTenteroclysis may be an appropriate option with excellent diagnostic performance.</p>
<p><strong>MR Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>MR enteroclysis is a MR-based examination in which a nasoduodenal tube is placed to allow controlled distentionof the small bowel. Typically, biphasic enteral contrast (low signal on T1 and high signal on T2) is infused, and IV contrast&nbsp; is&nbsp; given.&nbsp; There have&nbsp; been&nbsp; few&nbsp; studies evaluating&nbsp; performance in&nbsp; recent&nbsp; years.&nbsp; The&nbsp; overall&nbsp; diagnostic performance for MR&nbsp; enteroclysis is&nbsp; excellent&nbsp; and&nbsp; at&nbsp; least&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enterography&nbsp; [49].&nbsp; One comparisonstudy between these two modalities demonstrated statistically better detection of superficial mucosal abnormalities over MR enterography but no difference for stenoses and fistulas [50].</p>
<p>In this specific variant, MR enteroclysis may be limited dependent on the clinical acuity or severity of presentation. With&nbsp; a&nbsp; significant&nbsp; acute flare&nbsp; or&nbsp; complication, the&nbsp; patient would poorly&nbsp; tolerate MR&nbsp; enteroclysis because&nbsp; of&nbsp; themarked demands on the patient related to the placement of the nasoduodenal tube and need for active infusion of oral contrast. Here, the risks outweigh the added benefits of optimized bowel visualization, and this imaging choice should be avoided when acutely ill. In addition, patients are likely unable to hold still, leading to increased artifactand&nbsp; poorer&nbsp; image&nbsp; quality. If,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; the&nbsp; patient&nbsp; is&nbsp; relatively&nbsp; asymptomatic,&nbsp; MR&nbsp; enteroclysis may&nbsp; be&nbsp; an appropriate option with excellent diagnostic performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MR Enterography</strong></p>
<p>MR enterography combines contrast-enhanced MRI scanning using fast imaging techniques with an enterographyprotocol to optimize bowel distension [38]. As described with CT enterography, this requires the patient to ingest a large volume of oral contrast in a set time period. Additionally, the use of glucagon or prone imaging may help to&nbsp; decrease bowel peristalsis and thus artifact. MR enterography holds excellent test performance characteristics (seebelow) equivalent to other optimized modalities, such as CT enterography.</p>
<p>The performance of MR enterography for CD is very good. Rates of sensitivity and specificity are 77% to 82% and80% to 100%, respectively [24,66,67]; MR enterography can accurately display bowel-wall changes in CD [51-54]. Characteristic bowel-wall changes suggesting active inflammation include bowel-wall thickening, high T2 muralsignal, mural hyper enhancement with mural stratification, and hyperemic vasa recta [55-64]. MR cine imaging is potentially&nbsp; useful,&nbsp; allowing&nbsp; for assessment&nbsp; of&nbsp; decreased&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; motility&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affected&nbsp; segments&nbsp; with&nbsp; CD&nbsp; [65]. Besides inflammation, MRI can&nbsp; detect&nbsp; complications&nbsp; for CD&nbsp; that&nbsp; include&nbsp; obstruction,&nbsp; abscess,&nbsp; or&nbsp; fistula. Testperformance characteristics for complications are similar to CT enterography [27,28,35,40,68,69]. Overall, MRI is more prone to respiratory and bowel-motion artifact, despite the use of glucagon, which may lead to suboptimalexaminations and more difficult interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>MRI Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Standard MRI with a routine protocol (ie, MRI without and with IV contrast and without oral contrast enterography technique) can detect evidence of CD if the patient cannot tolerate large volumes of oral contrast. However, the lackof bowel optimization decreases evaluation of inflammation compared with MR enterography with optimized boweltechnique.&nbsp; One&nbsp; study&nbsp; (n&nbsp; =&nbsp; 100)&nbsp; reported&nbsp; a&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 50%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 86%&nbsp; and&nbsp; specificity&nbsp; of&nbsp; 93%&nbsp; to&nbsp; 94%&nbsp; for&nbsp; wallthickening [73]. For CD complications, the diagnostic ability of MRI is similar to its CT counterpart with similarreported sensitivities and specificities in various series [27,40,58,72]. The sensitivity for stenosis/obstruction rangesfrom 87% to 92% with high specificities; detection performance remains high for abscesses, with sensitivity ranging from 86% to 100%. As with CT, the detection for fistulas is more variable, ranging from 40% to 100%. Because ofthe superior soft-tissue contrast, perianal disease, including fistulation to the perineum, is best evaluated with MRI,using a small field of view, focused examination [74-76].</p>
<p>Standard MRI without IV contrast has been investigated because of emerging concerns with IV gadolinium use andpotential long-term accumulation in the body and brain. Noncontrast techniques such as DWI have been used to evaluate evidence for CD.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; growing literature&nbsp; examining its&nbsp; promise&nbsp; in&nbsp; detecting&nbsp; active&nbsp; disease versusquiescent disease, for complication evaluation, and disease monitoring, although many of the studies involve DWIin the context of enterography technique [77]. One study without enterography technique [48] reported a sensitivityof 49% to 82% and specificity of 85% to 93% for DWI, although lower specificities have been reported at meta-analysis [78] Overall,&nbsp; DWI&nbsp; appears to&nbsp; have&nbsp; moderate&nbsp; sensitivity&nbsp; but&nbsp; low&nbsp; specificity,&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; increased&nbsp; false positives for disease activity [77]. Thus, the current consensus is that noncontrast-only techniques such as DWI canbe done, but there is likely improved performance with the information gained from post-IV contrast series.</p>
<p>In this specific variant, MR may be limited. Acutely ill patients are less likely to be able to hold still for the duration of an MRI examination, leading to increased artifact and poorer image quality. In these instances, other options maybe preferable, particularly CT enterography or standard abdomen and pelvic CT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Radiography Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>Radiographs of the abdomen are limited in the evaluation of an acute flare or complication of CD. The ability to directly visualize bowel pathology is limited, and evidence for CD is instead inferred indirectly. There is little rolefor radiographs&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; patient&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; acutely&nbsp; ill. Radiographs&nbsp; may be&nbsp; useful&nbsp; in&nbsp; severely&nbsp; ill presenting&nbsp; patients&nbsp; forpresence of bowel perforation or evidence for obstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Fluoroscopy Small-Bowel Follow-Through and Fluoroscopic Enteroclysis</strong></p>
<p>Historically, fluoroscopic contrast examinations of the gastrointestinal tract have been the primary imaging methods of choice in the evaluation of CD.SBFT (with or without per oral pneumocolon) and enteroclysis can be used to evaluate the small bowel for evidence of thickening and active disease [50,79]. In addition, internal fistulas can be detected [80], although other extramural complications, such as abscess formation are only indirectly visualized, which leads to decreased detection [27]. It has become evident; however, with the emergence of specialized cross-sectional&nbsp; imaging modalities, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; fluoroscopy&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; as accurate for active disease compared with these other examinations [18,42,46,81,82]. Both SBFT and enteroclysis are hampered by their 2-Dperspective, whereby pathology can be obscured because of overlapping bowel loops [18,82,83]. On the other hand,the real-time assessment for a fixed versus pliable nature of a segment of bowel can provide important ancillaryinformation. Depending on institutional and surgeon preference, there may be a role in delineating the preoperativeanatomy for the surgeon, although there has been a marked decline in fluoroscopic use over recent years.</p>
<p><strong>Fluoroscopy Contrast Enema</strong></p>
<p>Colonoscopy is the preferred examination of the colon in patients suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease[9]. It is superior to the barium enema for the detection of early inflammatory changes and has largely replaced it as the&nbsp; initial diagnostic&nbsp; examination&nbsp; [9].&nbsp; Although&nbsp; contrast&nbsp; enemas can&nbsp; detect&nbsp; fistulas&nbsp; to&nbsp; other&nbsp; organs&nbsp; and&nbsp; sinustracts, it&nbsp;&nbsp; is poor for abscess determination given its&nbsp;&nbsp; non-cross-sectional nature.</p>
<p><strong>US Abdomen and Pelvis</strong></p>
<p>Transabdominal US can be an option in CD [84,85]. Technique requires a systematic survey pattern of the entirebowel with graded compression (ie, overlapping vertical sweeps with a high-frequency 5&ndash;17 MHz linear transducer)[11]. Sensitivities for disease detection range from 75% to 94%, with specificities of 67% to 100% for CD withdemonstration of&nbsp; wall&nbsp; thickening [66,86-88].&nbsp; The&nbsp; threshold for abnormal&nbsp; thickening is&nbsp; typically&nbsp; set&nbsp; at&nbsp; 4&nbsp; mm.Besides wall thickening, findings include alteration of the US gut signature, presence of fat wrapping, and vascularchanges [89-92]. US contrast and Doppler techniques appear helpful in determining inflammation [93-95]. The real-time&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; of&nbsp; bowel&nbsp; pliability&nbsp; and&nbsp; peristalsis can&nbsp; be&nbsp; helpful&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; diagnostic&nbsp; evaluation.&nbsp; Transperineal&nbsp; or endoanal US is also helpful at assessing perianal fistulous disease related to CD [96].</p>
<p><strong>HMPAO WBC Scan</strong></p>
<p>Leucoscintigraphy&nbsp; or&nbsp; Tc-99m-hexamethyl&nbsp; propylene&nbsp; amine&nbsp; oxime-labeled&nbsp; white&nbsp; blood cell&nbsp; (Tc-99m&nbsp; HMPAOWBC) scan have demonstrated good sensitivities and specificities for intestinal inflammation in the 79% to 85%and 81% to 98% range, respectively [98]. Proponents contend that leucoscintigraphy is useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of activity of extent of disease [99] with performance results equivalent to cross-sectional imaging [28].However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; disadvantages of&nbsp; this&nbsp; examination,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as the&nbsp; decreased&nbsp; ability&nbsp; to&nbsp; depict&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; detect alternative&nbsp; diagnoses&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; complicated&nbsp; time-consuming technical&nbsp; aspects (ie,&nbsp; labeling&nbsp; and&nbsp; handling of&nbsp; bloodproducts) have limited its use in initial diagnosis. Furthermore, leucoscintigraphy is limited in alternative diagnoses mimicking CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp; addition&nbsp; of&nbsp; metabolic&nbsp; information&nbsp; from&nbsp; PET with&nbsp; the&nbsp; morphologic&nbsp; anatomic imaging&nbsp; of&nbsp; CT&nbsp; or&nbsp; MR&nbsp; shows promise. It may be helpful to better assess the level of active inflammation from fibrosis [100,101]. Studies alsoshow improved assessment in the colon in a murine animal model [102], which points to potential future usefulness because the colon is less well evaluated at both CT enterography and MR enterography. At this point, there are fewlarge-series published clinical studies but small series show promising results [103,104].</p>
